# Module 4: Functions

**Note**: [Scala Language Specification]
can be used as an authoritative reference in case of doubts.

[Scala Language Specification]: https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/

## Function types

The following is an example of a simple function:

```scala
val triple = (n: Int) => n * 3
```

The *type* of this function literal is: `Int => Int`. We could have used
the *type annotation* to define triple:

```scala
val triple: Int => Int = n => n * 3
```

That can be read like:

> `triple` is a function that accepts an `Int` parameter and returns an
> `Int`

In general, to declare a **function type**, write:

```text
(A, B, ...) => C
```

where

- `A`, `B`, … are the types of the input parameters; and
- `C` is the type of the result.

******

### Naming conventions

Scala names are case sensitive. See [Naming conventions for constants, values, variables
and methods].

Can you tell why the following would *not* be a good name?

```scala
val Triple = (n: Float) => n * 3.0f
```

[Naming conventions for constants, values, variables and methods]: https://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html#constants-values-variable-and-methods

******

According to [Function Types]:

- Function types associate to the right, e.g. `S => T => U` is the
  same as `S => (T => U)`.
- An argument type of the form `=> T` represents a call-by-name
  parameter of type `T`.

[Function Types]: https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/03-types.html#function-types

### Relationship between methods and functions: eta–expansion

There is a close relationship between methods and functions, by means of
the [Eta--expansion]. For example,

```scala
def f1(n: Int): Int = n * 2

# Placeholder syntax
val f2: Int => Int = f1 _

# eta-expansion: equivalent to placeholder syntax
val f3: Int => Int = n => f1(n)
```

Given this close relationship, you will find methods referred to as
"functions", although they are not strictly the same.

[Eta--expansion]: https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.12/06-expressions.html#method-values

### Return value of a block

The last expression of a block becomes the value that the function
returns. For example, the following method returns the value of `r`
after the `for` loop (no need for the `return` keyword):

```scala
def fac(n: Int) = {
  var r = 1
  for (i <- 1 to n)
    r = r * i
  r
}
```

### Recursive functions/methods must specify the return type

```scala
def fac(n: Int): Int =
  if (n <= 0) 1
  else n * fac(n - 1)
```

### Varargs syntax

```scala
def sum(args: Int*): Int = {
  var result = 0
  for (arg <- args)
    result += arg
  result

val s = sum(1 to 5: _*)
```

### Procedures have `Unit` return value

```scala
def box(s : String) { // Look carefully: no =
  // contents elided
}

// (Equivalent) Explicit return type
def box(s : String): Unit = {
  // contents elided
}
```

### Scaladoc for `Function1`

Open [Current Scala Standard Library Scaladoc] and search documentation for trait `Function1`.
You should see documentation for important methods like `apply`, `andThen` and
`compose`.

[Current Scala Standard Library Scaladoc]: https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/

#### `apply`

In the following example (taken from `Function1` scaladoc), the
definition of `succ` is a shorthand for the anonymous class definition
`anonfun1`:

```scala
object Main extends App {
   val succ = (x: Int) => x + 1
   val anonfun1 = new Function1[Int, Int] {
     def apply(x: Int): Int = x + 1
   }
   assert(succ(0) == anonfun1(0))
}
```

#### `compose`

It has the following signature

```scala
def compose[A](g: (A) => T1): (A) => R
```

It models the mathematical function composition. For example, if
\(f(x) = x + 1\) and \(g(x) = 2x\),

$$
\begin{align}
(f \cdot g)(x) &= f(g(x)) = 2x + 1 \\
(g \cdot f)(x) &= g(f(x)) = 2(x + 1)
\end{align}
$$

Using Scala:

```scala
val f: Int => Int = x => x + 1
val g: Int => Int = x => 2 * x

// f "after" g, or g "then" f
// fg(x) = 2x + 1
val fg: Int => Int = f compose g

// g "after" f, or f "then" g
// gf1(x) = 2(x + 1)
val gf1: Int => Int = f andThen g
gf1(3)
// equivalently
val gf2: Int => Int = g compose f
gf2(3)
```

******

#### Scala "Universal" `toString` method

Scala creates a `toString` method automatically for all classes.
Functions also get a default (useless, and pretty arbitrary)
implementation for `toString` method.

Notice that `FunctionN` traits are not sealed, so you could `override` it’s implementation to get a
more meaningful implementation.

******

## Composition

We have reviewed composition in the mathematical sense. This may seem
too theoretical, but is a wonderful tool to get complex solutions from
smaller building blocks. We are going to use `atto`, a parsing library
that uses `andThen` to build a new parser from smaller parsers.
Spend some time studying the section on [basic parsers].

[basic parsers]: http://tpolecat.github.io/atto/docs/first-steps.html

### Exercises

- Discuss your understanding on Basic Parsers with others. Study
  first.
- Following tutorial, replicate the example given in your development
  machine.

## Currying

Let’s take a look at `Functions2` trait scaladoc. It is used for
functions that accept *two* arguments. For example:

```tut
val add1: (Int, Int) => Int = _ + _
```

A *curried* version of the above is:

```tut
val add2: Int => Int => Int = a => b => a + b
```

From [Scala for the Impatient, 2nd Edition]:

******

Currying (named after logician Haskell Brooks Curry) is the process of
turning a function that takes two arguments into a function that takes
one argument. That function returns a function that consumes the second
argument.

******

[Scala for the Impatient, 2nd Edition]: http://www.informit.com/store/scala-for-the-impatient-9780134540634?ranMID=24808

You can get a curried version of a `FunctionN` by calling `curried`:

```tut
add1.curried // returns an equivalent of add2
```

On the other hand, you can call `Function.uncurried` to "uncurry":

```tut
Function.uncurried(add2) // returns an equivalent of add1
```

Currying buys us (at least) 2 things in Scala:

1. Partial application
2. Better type inference

Partial application is the ability to apply only some of a function’s
arguments. For example

```tut
val addTen: Int => Int = add2(10)
```

Here is an example from the Scala Standard Library to explain the second
point. Take a look at `List.foldRight()`’s type signature:

```scala
def foldRight[B](z: B)(op: (A, B) => B): B
```

The `z` and `op` values are separate curried parameters. The *type
inferencer* can figure out what `B` is from the type of `z`, and then it
can use that information when analyzing the function that is passed for
`op`.

Notice that one way to achieve currying in Scala is by using multiple
parameter lists.

## Generics and parametric polymorphism

Generics is a powerful tool from modern programming languages. Back in
early 2000’s even some product team members from Microsoft considered
that “generics \[was\] [for academics only]”.

At the moment of writing, several mainstream languages feature generic
collections in their Standard API/library. See for example:

- [Java Collections API]
- [C# generics collections]

[for academics only]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dsyme/2011/03/15/netc-generics-history-some-photos-from-feb-1999/
[Java Collections API]: https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html
[C# generics collections]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/collections

Scala has higher level of support for generic programming, than Java and
C\#. See:

Oliveira, Bruno CdS, Adriaan Moors, and Martin Odersky.  
"Type Classes as Objects and Implicits."  
In ACM Sigplan Notices, 45:341–360. ACM, 2010.

Now, let’s review some of the basics.

### Polymorphism

“Polymorphic” means “made of many forms”, in contrast with
“monomorphic”, “made of one form”. In Scala, you can use several
kinds of polymorphism:

- Subtyping polymorphism (reviewed in “Objects and classes” Module)
- Parametric polymorphism
- Ad hoc (or constrained) polymorphism

#### Subtyping/dynamic polymorphism

The following snippet illustrates subtyping polymorphism, and how we can
constraint type parameters with the [upper type bound] `T <: Shape` ().

```scala
sealed trait Shape
case class Square(l: Double) extends Shape
case class Circle(radius: Double) extends Shape

// Constraining T to be a subtype of Shape
// area is still a generic method
def area[T <: Shape](t: T) = ???
```

Take a look at [lower type bounds] for documentation on lower type bounds.

[upper type bound]: https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/upper-type-bounds.html
[lower type bounds]: https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/lower-type-bounds.html

#### Parametric polymorphism

Parametric polymorphism refers to type variables, or parameters, that
are fully polymorphic. When **unconstrained** by a typeclass, their final,
concrete type could be anything.

Let’s use `List.map` as an example:

```scala
final def map[B](f: (A) => B): List[B]
```

`List[A]` is a polymorphic/generic collection. It can hold elements of
the same arbitrary type `A`. In turn, `List.map` is a polymorphic
method, that accepts any function that transforms an `A` into an
arbitrary type `B`, and produces a `List` of elements of type `B`.

Making `type A = Int`, `type B = String`:

```scala
val ns = List(1, 2, 3, 4)
val ss = ns.map(_.toString)
```

*Classes can be parametric* also, for example:

```scala
case class Pair[A, B](first: A, second: B) {
  def swap: Pair[B, A] = Pair(second, first)
}
```

#### Ad hoc polymorphism

******

**Prerequisite**: Study [Context Bounds].

[Context Bounds]: https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/FAQ/context-bounds.html

******

Types can be *constrained* in generic functions, by using *typeclasses*.
Let’s start by reviewing `Ordering[T]` from the Scala Standard Library.

```scala
// Type class Constraint
import scala.math.Ordering.Implicits._

def myMax[T : Ordering](x: T, y: T): T =
  if (x > y) x else y;
```

The following (more advanced) example is an excerpt from an
implementation of the *k-means* algorithm ([Spire] GitHub repository):

[Spire]: https://github.com/non/spire

```scala
/**
  * Returns a collection of k points which are the centers of k clusters of
  * `points0`.
  */
def kMeans[V, @sp(Double) A, CC[V] <: Iterable[V]](points0: CC[V], k: Int)(implicit
    vs: NormedVectorSpace[V, A], order: Order[A],
    cbf: CanBuildFrom[Nothing, V, CC[V]], ct: ClassTag[V]): CC[V] = {

  // code elided

  // This is the main loop of the k-means algorithm. Given a new clustering
  // and some previous assignments mapping each point to a cluster, we
  // determine if the new clustering will cause any points to switch
  // clusters. If so, we re-assign all points to their closest center in the
  // clustering, then find new centers using the centroids of the points
  // assigned to each cluster, rinse, repeat.
  @tailrec
  def loop(assignments0: Array[Int], clusters0: Array[V]): Array[V] = {
    val assignments = assign(clusters0)
    if (assignments === assignments0) {
      clusters0
    } else {
      val clusters = Array.fill[V](clusters0.length)(vs.zero)
      val counts = new Array[Int](clusters0.length)
      cfor(0)(_ < points.length, _ + 1) { i =>
        val idx = assignments(i)
        clusters(idx) = clusters(idx) + points(i)
        counts(idx) += 1
      }
      cfor(0)(_ < clusters.length, _ + 1) { j =>
        clusters(j) = clusters(j) :/ vs.scalar.fromInt(counts(j))
      }
      loop(assignments, clusters)
    }
  }

}
```

Notice there are several advanced uses of Scala features, including ad
hoc polymorphism, specialization and implicits.

## Functions and Dependency Injection

******

**Prerequisite**: [Dead-Simple Dependency Injection]

[Dead-Simple Dependency Injection]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZasXwtTRkio

******

The following abstraction (`Reader[A]` monad), can be used to implement
dependency injection in a functional way.

```scala
object Reader {
  implicit def reader[A, B](f: A => B): Reader[A, B] = Reader(f)
  def pure[C, A](a: A): Reader[C, A] =
    (_: C) => a
}

case class Reader[C, A](g: C => A) {
  // Pulling in implicit conversion reader
  import Reader._

  def apply(c: C): A = g(c) // or "run"
  def map[B](f: A => B): Reader[C, B] =
    (c: C) => f(g(c))
  def flatMap[B](f: A => Reader[C, B]): Reader[C, B] =
    (c: C) => f(g(c))(c)
}
```

Instead of implementing our own `Reader[A]` abstraction, we will use
cats library implementation (to pull a more robust/complete
implementation). Still, we will be using the same ideas/patterns.

```scala
import java.sql.{Connection, DriverManager, PreparedStatement}

import cats.data.Reader

object DB {
  type DB[A] = Reader[Connection, A]
  type UserId = String
  type Pwd = String

  implicit def reader[A](g: Connection => A): DB[A] = Reader(g)

  def pure[A](a: A): DB[A] = Reader(_ => a)
  
  // Code elided
}
```

Some primitive operations that are delaying the definition of a
`Connection` database:

```scala
def setUserPwd(id: UserId,
               pwd: Pwd): Connection => Unit =
  c => {
    val stmt: PreparedStatement =
      c.prepareStatement("update users set pwd = ? where id  = ?")
    stmt.setString(1, pwd)
    stmt.setString(2, id)
    stmt.executeUpdate()
    stmt.close()
  }

def getUserPwd(id: UserId): Connection => Pwd =
  c => {
    val stmt: PreparedStatement =
      c.prepareStatement("select pwd where id = ?")
    stmt.setString(1, id)
    val resultSet = stmt.executeQuery()
    val pwd = resultSet.getString(0)
    stmt.close()
    pwd
  }
```

Now we are able to express database “actions”, without referring to a
database `Connection` at all:

```scala
def changePwd(userId: UserId,
              oldPwd: Pwd,
              newPwd: Pwd): DB[Boolean] =
  for {
    pwd <- getUserPwd(userId)
    eq <- if (pwd == oldPwd) for {
      _ <- setUserPwd(userId, newPwd)
    } yield true
    else pure(false)
  } yield eq
```

And we can define different database connection providers: one for
testing and some other for production purposes:

```scala
abstract class ConnProvider {
  def apply[A](f: DB[A]): A
}

lazy val sqliteTestDB: ConnProvider =
  mkProvider("org.sqlite.JDBC", "jdbc:sqlite::memory:")

lazy val mysqlProdDB: ConnProvider =
  mkProvider(
    "org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver",
    "jdbc:mysql://prod:3306/?user=one&password=two")
```

We can define *interpreters* to process our `DB[A]` actions:

```scala
def mkProvider(driver: String, url: String): ConnProvider =
  new ConnProvider {
    override def apply[A](f: DB[A]): A = {
      //Class.forName(driver)
      val conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url)
      try {
        f(conn)
      }
      finally {
        conn.close()
      }
    }
  }
```

And “programs” or descriptions of the computations on our `DB[A]`
actions. For example, next one describes how to change a user password,
but without fixing the connection provider that eventually will be used:

```scala
def myProgram(userId: UserId): ConnProvider => Unit =
  r => {
    println("Enter old password")
    val oldPwd = readLine()
    println("Ender new password")
    val newPwd = readLine()
    r(changePwd(userId, oldPwd, newPwd))
  }
```

And finally, the actual “injection” of different implementations
(Testing Vs. Production) of a `ConnectionProvider`:

```scala
def runInTest[A](f: ConnProvider => A): A =
  f(sqliteTestDB)

def runInProduction[A](f: ConnProvider => A): A =
  f(mysqlProdDB)

def main(args: Array[String]) =
  runInTest(myProgram(args(0)))
```
