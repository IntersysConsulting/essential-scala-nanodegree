### Training objectives

- Get familiar with fold, map and flatMap.
- Identify the ideal pattern one should use to get certain results.

------

### What skills will the trainee obtain?

- Will brighten its scope about generics.
- Will know how to use and implement fold, map and flatMap.

------

### Agenda

- fold
- map and flatMap
- Functional programming constructs in action 

------

### Sequencing computation

One way to take advantage of generics is sequencing computation. On this module we will
review a couple of patterns for using generic data.
