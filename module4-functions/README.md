# Functions

A lot can be achieved by using functions. We are spending some time explaining valuable patterns that can be implemented with "Functions all the way".

**Instructions for exercises/coding**:

1. You will need to work on the project inside `module4functions` subdirectory.
2. Notice we are going to use Erik Osheim's (@non) kind-projector to simplify type annotations. Please take a look at the [REAME.md](https://github.com/non/kind-projector/blob/master/README.md** before proceeding.

## Function types

## Composition

We are going to use [atto](https://tpolecat.github.io/atto/) to explain this topic.

## Currying

Explain:

* The advantages of using currying: partial application of function arguments can simplify programming.
* How to curry/uncurry to interoperate with OOP code.

## Generics and parametric polymorphism

## Functions and dependency injection

(Note: Used a simplified version of Reader (Kleisli) to explain how to abstract the Dependency Injection Pattern)
